# Machine-learning-Fake-Bank-Note-Detection

I am trying to predict whether the banknote is forged or genuine with the data set obtained \cite{UCI_Machine}. This is clearly a classification problem so I will use machine learning algorithms like Support Vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF). I have compared their learning curves, validation curves, metrics and determine which is more accurate.
